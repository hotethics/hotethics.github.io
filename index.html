          <p> <font size = "3">The Workshop on Hot Topics in Ethical Computer Systems (HotEthics'24) provides a unique forum for cutting-edge research on identifying challenges and exploring innovative approaches to align technology with ethical principles in computer systems.This motivation is in the same vein as the recent plenary talk at FCRC by Prof. Margaret Martonosi, the ex-NSF associate director, on the need for emerging research on socially-responsible system design. Researchers can share their research and experiences, while discussing new challenges and opportunities in building socially conscious system infrastructures. The topics span across the full system stack with a focus on potential ethical concerns arising from system and architecture design choices, or resolving existing ethical issues through careful system and architecture design.</font></p>

                      <b>Abstract:</b> Computing is responsible for a significant and growing fraction of the world's global carbon footprint. Combating climate change and preserving sustainability in general is a grand challenge. This paper describes the sustainability gap for computing as a result of the socio-economic context (population and affluence growth) versus technology: the status quo in which we keep per-device carbon footprint constant would lead to a 5.4x gap relative to the Paris agreement within a decade. Meeting the Paris agreement for computing requires reducing the per-device carbon footprint by 15.5% per year under current population and affluence growth curves. Based on a select number of published carbon footprint reports, it appears that while (some) vendors indeed reduce the carbon footprint for (some) of their products, it does not seem to be enough to close the gap, urging our community to do more.

                      <b>Abstract:</b> Server CPUs in the cloud have inherited their core microarchitecture from the desktop and mobile world, with performance primarily measured by single-core IPC. Furthermore, cores are integrated with large cache hierarchies within sockets and rely heavily on these caches to contain chip power envelopes, with little consideration given to utilization by workloads. Wasted silicon impacts both operational and embodied emissions in server platforms. In this work, we measure and compare silicon efficiency measured in performance per area and performance per watt of online and analytic services running on two x86 and an ARM server. We show that while x86 platforms offer higher single-core performance, the ARM server has the potential to achieve up to 2.5x higher socket-level performance per area and performance per watt than the x86 servers in the absence of system-level bottlenecks (e.g., memory or network bandwidth).

                      <b>Abstract:</b> The dawning of the age of accelerators has been a boon for computer architects and more broadly design and innovation in the computer hardware industry. However, as we spin and respin new accelerator designs, we must be cognizant of the broader implications of frequent redesign and accelerator churn. Specifically, we introduce the notion of lifetime carbon amortization and impact of legacy carbon due to frequent design refreshes. We argue for a more thoughtful and sustainable approach to accelerator design and deployment.

                      <b>Abstract:</b> The growth of sensing devices enables a wide range of previously untenable applications from sustainable agriculture to wildlife monitoring. At the same time, this growth necessitates considering the sustainability impact of these devices. Such devices capture sensor data, process it locally and radio-transmit it to the cloud via internet-enabled basestations. While some prior work has begun inspecting emissions at a device level, we need to understand the carbon impact of the entire sensing pipeline — from the sensing device to the cloud. Simply focusing on the device leaves several end-to-end impacts unexplored, both negative and positive. In this paper, we describe this end-to-end view of the sensing pipeline and show how one design decision in the sensing device affects the entire pipeline’s carbon impact.

                      <b>Abstract:</b> The electronics and semiconductor industry are a prominent consumer of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as forever chemicals. Computer designers and architects have an opportunity to reduce the use of PFAS in manufacturing semiconductors and electronics, including integrated circuits, batteries, displays, etc., which currently account for a staggering 10% of the total PFAS fluoropolymers usage in Europe alone. In this paper, we discuss the environmental impact of PFAS in computing systems, and how designers and architects can optimize for designs with lower PFAS-containing chemicals. We show that manufacturing a design with 16 nm technology node result in 15% less PFAS volume than manufacturing with a 28 nm lagging technology node due to area savings. We also show that manufacturing an IC at a 7 nm technology node using Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography uses 20% less volume of PFAS-containing chemicals, compared to manufacturing the same design at 7 nm technology node using Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) immersion lithography (instead of EUV).

                      <b>Abstract:</b> Addressing the rapid increase in global e-waste production requires a shift towards electronics repair, which not only mitigates e-waste but also reduces the carbon footprint associated with manufacturing new devices. While Right to Repair legislation aims to push manufacturers to design for repairability, 'repairability' is multifaceted, encompassing technical, practical, and socio-behavioral aspects. This study examines the attitudes and experiences of engineering students towards electronics repair, revealing gaps in both practical skills and awareness of environmental implications of their work, and a general lack of `repairabiliy' in existing consumer electronics. Despite their technical background, most students feel unprepared for repair and lack understanding of its environmental significance. The findings underscore the need for educational reforms that integrate repair skills and environmental literacy into engineering curricula to promote repairability in the design of personal electronics.

                      <b>Abstract:</b> The sharply increasing sizes of artificial intelligence (AI) models come with significant energy consumption and environmental footprints, which can disproportionately impact certain (often marginalized) regions and hence create environmental inequity concerns. Moreover, concerns with social inequity have also emerged, as AI computing resources may not be equitably distributed across the globe and users from certain disadvantaged regions with severe resource constraints can consistently experience inferior model performance. Importantly, the inequity concerns that encompass both social and environmental dimensions still remain unexplored and have increasingly hindered responsible AI. In this paper, we leverage the spatial flexibility of AI inference workloads and propose equitable geographical load balancing (GLB) to fairly balance AI’s regional social and environmental costs. Concretely, to penalize the disproportionately high social and environmental costs for equity, we introduce Lq norms as novel regularization terms into the optimization objective for GLB decisions. Our empirical results based on real-world AI inference traces demonstrate that while the existing GLB algorithms result in disproportionately large social and environmental costs in certain regions, our proposed equitable GLB can fairly balance AI’s negative social and environmental costs across all the regions.

                      <b>Abstract:</b> The sustained growth of carbon emissions and global waste elicits significant sustainability concerns for our environment's future. The growing Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to exacerbate this issue. However, an emerging area known as Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) has the opportunity to help address these environmental challenges through sustainable computing practices. TinyML, the deployment of machine learning (ML) algorithms onto low-cost, low-power microcontroller systems, enables on-device sensor analytics that unlocks numerous always-on ML applications. This article discusses both the potential of these TinyML applications to address critical sustainability challenges, as well as the environmental footprint of this emerging technology. Through a complete life cycle analysis (LCA), we find that TinyML systems present opportunities to offset their carbon emissions by enabling applications that reduce the emissions of other sectors. Nevertheless, when globally scaled, the carbon footprint of TinyML systems is not negligible, necessitating that designers factor in environmental impact when formulating new devices. Finally, we outline research directions to enable further sustainable contributions of TinyML.

                      <b>Abstract:</b> Designs for implanted brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have increased significantly in recent years. Each device promises better clinical outcomes and quality-of-life improvements, yet due to severe and inflexible safety constraints, progress requires tight co-design from materials to circuits and all the way up the stack to applications and algorithms. This trend has become more aggressive over time, forcing clinicians and patients to rely on vendor-specific hardware and software for deployment, maintenance, upgrades, and replacement. This over-reliance is ethically problematic, especially if companies go out-of-business or business objectives diverge from clinical promises. Device heterogeneity additionally burdens clinicians and healthcare facilities, adding complexity and costs for in-clinic visits, monitoring, and continuous access.

                    <p>
                      Reliability, interoperability, portability, and future-proofed design is needed, but this unfortunately comes at a cost. These system features sap resources that would have otherwise been allocated to reduce power/energy and improve performance. Navigating this trade-off in a systematic way is critical to providing patients with forever access to their implants and reducing burdens placed on healthcare providers and caretakers. We study the integration of on-device storage to highlight the sensitivity of this trade-off and establish other points of interest within BCI design that require careful investigation. In the process, we revisit relevant problems in computer architecture and medical devices from the current era of hardware specialization and modern neurotechnology.

They are increasingly incorporating processing capabilities to analyze and stimulate neural activity, and consequently, pose unique design challenges related to ethics, law and policy. For the first time, this paper articulates how ethical, legal, and policy considerations can shape BCI architecture design, and how decisions that architects make can constrain or expand the ethical, legal and policy frameworks that can be applied to them.

                      <b>Abstract:</b> The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers who are interested in "designing computer systems and architectures in a socially responsible way'". This paper starts with simple question: Why do we -- as researchers who are interested in such issues -- feel the need for a special workshop devoted to this topic? To wit, why isn't social responsibility important in all technical conferences, and treated as just another metric along which systems are evaluated? Our response to this question consists of two obvious observations, that in turn lead us to the more fundamental question: How can this emerging "socially responsible" community have impact?

In this position paper, we explore an overlooked area: ethical dimensions of benchmarking practices in computer architecture. The selection of benchmarks embeds underlying ethical values into the final design. In light of this, we identify and discuss various shortcomings in current benchmark practices, point out their ethical implications, and make several proposals for how the computer architecture field can address them.

                      <b>Abstract:</b> The Internet is the centerpiece of the world's communication infrastructure, and it touches almost all aspects of our lives. Thus, if there is any technology that should be designed in a socially conscious manner, it is the Internet. This short paper discusses what the Internet was, what it is now, and what it could become, all from the perspective of (quoting from this workshop's CfP) "potential ethical concerns arising from system and architecture design choices." Given the limitations on length, this paper focuses on identifying a few crucial, but often overlooked, social concerns related to the architectural design choices for the Internet, and leaves the details of our proposed solution to longer descriptions available elsewhere.

                      <b>Abstract:</b> Modern web systems typically adopt a "performance-first" approach, where they prioritize sending quick responses to the end user to improve the Quality of Experience (QoE). However, putting performance first might make web systems introduce request priorities that may cause responses to be biased against certain user demographics. For example, to improve QoE, prior work often prioritizes requests that face lower network delays, implicitly causing biases against some requests that originate from rural areas.

                      We make a case for how web systems must consider demographic bias as a key systems concern, to prevent discrimination against certain users. To this end, we systematically study and define demographic bias. We investigate whether modern web systems, especially scheduling systems, can (unintentionally) introduce demographic bias to improve performance, precipitating discrimination against certain user demographics. We detail a case study to show that demographic bias does occur in an open-source ML-driven scheduler that uses the Shortest Job First policy.
