          <p> <font size = "3">The Workshop on Hot Topics in Ethical Computer Systems (HotEthics'24) provides a unique forum for cutting-edge research on identifying challenges and exploring innovative approaches to align technology with ethical principles in computer systems.This motivation is in the same vein as the recent plenary talk at FCRC by Prof. Margaret Martonosi, the ex-NSF associate director, on the need for emerging research on socially-responsible system design. Researchers can share their research and experiences, while discussing new challenges and opportunities in building socially conscious system infrastructures. The topics span across the full system stack with a focus on potential ethical concerns arising from system and architecture design choices, or resolving existing ethical issues through careful system and architecture design.</font></p>

                      <b>Abstract:</b> Computing is responsible for a significant and growing fraction of the world's global carbon footprint. Combating climate change and preserving sustainability in general is a grand challenge. This paper describes the sustainability gap for computing as a result of the socio-economic context (population and affluence growth) versus technology: the status quo in which we keep per-device carbon footprint constant would lead to a 5.4x gap relative to the Paris agreement within a decade. Meeting the Paris agreement for computing requires reducing the per-device carbon footprint by 15.5% per year under current population and affluence growth curves. Based on a select number of published carbon footprint reports, it appears that while (some) vendors indeed reduce the carbon footprint for (some) of their products, it does not seem to be enough to close the gap, urging our community to do more.

                      <b>Abstract:</b> Server CPUs in the cloud have inherited their core microarchitecture from the desktop and mobile world, with performance primarily measured by single-core IPC. Furthermore, cores are integrated with large cache hierarchies within sockets and rely heavily on these caches to contain chip power envelopes, with little consideration given to utilization by workloads. Wasted silicon impacts both operational and embodied emissions in server platforms. In this work, we measure and compare silicon efficiency measured in performance per area and performance per watt of online and analytic services running on two x86 and an ARM server. We show that while x86 platforms offer higher single-core performance, the ARM server has the potential to achieve up to 2.5x higher socket-level performance per area and performance per watt than the x86 servers in the absence of system-level bottlenecks (e.g., memory or network bandwidth).

                      <b>Abstract:</b> The dawning of the age of accelerators has been a boon for computer architects and more broadly design and innovation in the computer hardware industry. However, as we spin and respin new accelerator designs, we must be cognizant of the broader implications of frequent redesign and accelerator churn. Specifically, we introduce the notion of lifetime carbon amortization and impact of legacy carbon due to frequent design refreshes. We argue for a more thoughtful and sustainable approach to accelerator design and deployment.

                      <b>Abstract:</b> The growth of sensing devices enables a wide range of previously untenable applications from sustainable agriculture to wildlife monitoring. At the same time, this growth necessitates considering the sustainability impact of these devices. Such devices capture sensor data, process it locally and radio-transmit it to the cloud via internet-enabled basestations. While some prior work has begun inspecting emissions at a device level, we need to understand the carbon impact of the entire sensing pipeline — from the sensing device to the cloud. Simply focusing on the device leaves several end-to-end impacts unexplored, both negative and positive. In this paper, we describe this end-to-end view of the sensing pipeline and show how one design decision in the sensing device affects the entire pipeline’s carbon impact.

                      <b>Abstract:</b> Machine learning (ML) has achieved impressive success in a variety of field. It is widely recognized that increasing model parameters can enhance ML model capabilities. As a result, the sizes of ML models have grown exponentially in recent years. However, this expansion in model parameters introduces computational and memory-related challenges. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a potential solution to mitigate computational costs. In traditional dense models, the computational cost increases linearly with the model size since all parameters are involved in the training process. MoE models differ from traditional dense models as they partition and selectively activate a subset of parameters, resulting in improved model quality without substantially increasing computational costs. However, MoE models require additional memory capacity, leading to the adoption of high-capacity, expensive HBM for quick off-GPU memory access. As GPU memory has not scaled proportionately, it has given rise to the challenge known as the GPU memory wall. Memory expansion techniques can help overcome the GPU memory wall challenge by enabling GPUs to access remote memory. Although memory expansion has been studied for decades, it has not been explored in the context of training MoE models. This study aims to investigate a range of memory expansion design options, with the goal of optimizing both performance and performance per cost for training 1 Trillion parameter MoE models.

                      <b>Abstract:</b> Compute and memory are tightly coupled within traditional datacenter servers. Large-scale datacenter operators have identified this coupling as a root cause behind fleet-wide resource underutilization and increasing Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). With the advent of ultra-fast networks and cache-coherent interfaces, memory disaggregation has emerged as a potential solution, whereby applications can leverage available memory even outside server boundaries. In this paper, we discuss some open challenges from a software perspective toward building next-generation memory disaggregation systems leveraging emerging cache-coherent interconnects.

                      <b>Abstract:</b> With Intel's announcement to discontinue its Optane DC Persistent Memory (DCPMM) in July 2022, it's time to learn from our existing experience and look to its future. In this paper, we have 1) carried out a survey of public reports from organizations to understand how they utilize DCPMM; 2) measured the performance of the DCPMM 200 series to understand whether it could have saved the product; and 3) discussed with corresponding developers in major IT companies. Based on such information, we argue the memory mode of DCPMM is worth more attention and it is necessary to study the sweet spots for persistent memory before heavy investment.

                <b>Abstract</b>
                <br>
                Datacenters are the pillars of a digital economy and modern-day global IT services. The building blocks for today's datacenters are cost-effective volume servers that find their roots in the basic hardware and OS organization of the desktops of 90s with a fundamental mismatch with datacenter workloads and services. Meanwhile, there are many technological trends (e.g., slowdown in Moore's Law), application trends (e.g., rapid adoption of AI) and societal challenges (e.g., climate impact of computing) that dictate innovation in datacenter design from algorithms to housing infrastructure. Post-Moore datacenters are hot because of both their trajectory to consume (and dissipate) unprecedented levels of energy and the many hot research avenues to pursue for an infrastructure whose building blocks belong to the 90s. In this talk, I will motivate and go over these research avenues.

                Babak is a Professor and the founding director of EcoCloud at EPFL. His contributions to computer systems include the first NUMA multiprocessors built by Sun Microsystems (WildFire/WildCat), memory streaming integrated in IBM BlueGene (temporal) and ARM cores (spatial), and performance evaluation methodologies in use by AMD, HP and Google PerfKit. He has shown that memory consistency models are neither necessary nor sufficient to achieve high performance in servers. These results led to fence speculation in modern CPUs. His work on workload-optimized server processors laid the foundation for the first generation of Cavium ARM server CPUs, ThunderX. He is a recipient of an Alfred P.

                      <b>Abstract:</b> To address the threat of climate change, new methods are needed to reduce the significant and increasing carbon emissions of datacenter computing systems. Minimizing hardware waste is crucial to achieve carbon reductions, as previous research has shown that up to 50% of datacenter emissions are "embodied" emissions resulting from the manufacturing and transport of server hardware. This study takes a first step in understanding how older hardware can be reused in a datacenter setting while preserving end-to-end service performance. We perform the first set of experiments to analyze the end-to-end and per-microservice performance of a datacenter application on two different server types and generations. The results of our experiments identify specific operating regions where older hardware does not degrade application performance. Our work motivates a scheduling system that exploit microservices' behavior on certain hardware generations to prevent environmentally costly server refreshes and hardware waste.

                      <b>Abstract:</b> Cloud applications are increasingly moving away from their traditional monolithic nature and are adopting the structure of complex loosely-coupled microservices. Service meshes are widely used for implementing microservices applications mainly because they provide a modular architecture for modern applications by separating operational features from application business logic. Sidecar proxies in service meshes enable this modularity by applying security, networking, and monitoring policies on the traffic to and from services. To implement these policies, sidecars often execute complex chains of logic that vary across associated applications and end up unevenly impacting the performance of the overall application. Lack of understanding of how the sidecars impact the performance of microservice-based applications stands in the way of building performant and resource-efficient applications. To this end, we bring sidecar proxies in focus and argue that we need to deeply study their impact on the system performance and resource utilization. We identify and describe challenges in characterizing sidecars, namely the need for microarchitectural metrics and comprehensive methodologies, and discuss research directions where such characterization will help in building efficient service mesh infrastructure for microservice applications.

                      <b>Abstract:</b> Software-defined networking (SDN) and software-defined flash (SDF) have been becoming the backbone of modern data centers. They are managed separately to handle I/O requests. At first glance, this is a reasonable design by following the rack-scale hierarchical design principles. But it suffers from suboptimal end-to-end performance, due to the lack of coordination between SDN and SDF.

                      In this paper, we take an initial effort towards building the next-generation software-defined data center by co-designing the SDN and SDF stacks. We redefine the functions of their control plane and data plane, and split them up with a new architecture named NetFlash. NetFlash has three major components: (1) coordinated I/O scheduling, to coordinate the effort of I/O scheduling across the network and storage stack achieve predictable end-to-end performance; (2) coordinated garbage collection (GC), to coordinate the GC across the SSDs in a rack to minimize their impact on incoming I/O requests; (3) rack-scale wear leveling, which enables global wear leveling among SSDs in a rack by periodically swapping data, for achieving improved device lifetime for the rack.

                      <b>Abstract:</b> The Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite edge has emerged as a promising solution to alleviate data congestion on satellite-ground links. However, existing approaches either offer inflexible fixed-function deployments or focus solely on addressing infrastructure mobility. In this paper, we shed light on the unique challenges posed by the varying energy harvested by satellites, which necessitates a fresh perspective on orchestration within satellites. Our work serves as a compelling call to integrate energy as a first-class metric for orchestrating applications within the LEO satellite infrastructure, posed as the new frontier of computing infrastructure.

                      <b>Abstract:</b> Autoscaling edge servers introduces additional processing time due to the rigid configuration of containers' resource limits, rendering it unsuitable for delay-sensitive Radio Access Network (RAN) slicing workloads. We propose a fine-grained autoscaling for RAN slicing workloads in edge cloud. We introduce an analytical approach that dynamically tunes resource limits based on the inherent fluctuations in radio workloads using stochastic decision processes. Accordingly, we enable the system to effectively meet the dynamic demands for resources. We show preliminary results utilizing the Roofline model and asymptotic analysis of the Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) decoding algorithm as a comprehensive case study for radio workload characterization. Leveraging this analysis, we establish processing time design constraints. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of our proposed model and delineate avenues for future research.
